== Description ==

5 Vote Free Photos is a collection of free photo collections hosted by http://www.5vote.com.  This plugin allows you to tap into this content without any fees, subscriptions or accounts.  Use the plugin to display a collection of photos in your posts and pages right from your wordpress installation.  

While editing a post, simply hit the provided control button (tinyMCE button) to be presented with the 5 Vote control panel.

Several options are provided to allow you to customize how your 5 Vote photo collection is displayed.  For example you can choose to hide the sharing options as well as limit the number of photos to display.
